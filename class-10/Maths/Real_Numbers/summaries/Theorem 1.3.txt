### Theorem 1.3

**Statement:** $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

**Proof (by contradiction):**
1.  **Assume the contrary:** Let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\sqrt{2}$ is a **rational number**.
2.  **Express as a fraction:** If $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, then we can write it in the form $\frac{r}{s}$, where $r$ and $s$ are integers and $s \ne 0$.
    So, $\sqrt{2} = \frac{r}{s}$.
3.  **Simplify the fraction:** If $r$ and $s$ have any common factors other than 1, we can divide both $r$ and $s$ by that common factor until we get a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are **coprime** (meaning they have no common factors other than 1).
    So, $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are coprime integers and $b \ne 0$.
4.  **Rearrange and square:**
    Multiply both sides by $b$: $b\sqrt{2} = a$
    Square both sides: $(b\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2$
    $2b^2 = a^2$
5.  **Deduce divisibility of `a`:** The equation $2b^2 = a^2$ implies that $a^2$ is divisible by 2.
    According to **Theorem 1.2** (If a prime $p$ divides $a^2$, then $p$ divides $a$), since 2 is a prime number and 2 divides $a^2$, it must be that **2 divides $a$**.
6.  **Express `a` in terms of 2:** Since 2 divides $a$, we can write $a$ as $2c$ for some integer $c$.
7.  **Substitute and deduce divisibility of `b`:** Substitute $a = 2c$ into the equation $2b^2 = a^2$:
    $2b^2 = (2c)^2$
    $2b^2 = 4c^2$
    Divide both sides by 2: $b^2 = 2c^2$
    This equation implies that $b^2$ is divisible by 2.
    Again, using **Theorem 1.2**, since 2 is a prime number and 2 divides $b^2$, it must be that **2 divides $b$**.
8.  **Identify the contradiction:** We have now concluded that:
    * 2 divides $a$ (from step 5)
    * 2 divides $b$ (from step 7)
    This means that $a$ and $b$ have at least 2 as a common factor.
    However, in step 3, we specifically stated that $a$ and $b$ are **coprime**, meaning they have no common factors other than 1.
    This creates a **contradiction**: $a$ and $b$ cannot have a common factor of 2 *and* be coprime at the same time.
9.  **Conclude original statement:** This contradiction arose because our initial assumption that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational was incorrect.
    Therefore, our assumption must be false, and we conclude that **$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational**.

**Example 5: Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.**

**Solution (by contradiction):**
1.  **Assume the contrary:** Let us assume, to the contrary, that $\sqrt{3}$ is a **rational number**.
2.  **Express as a fraction:** If $\sqrt{3}$ is rational, we can write it as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are coprime integers and $b \ne 0$.
    So, $\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}$.
3.  **Rearrange and square:**
    Multiply both sides by $b$: $b\sqrt{3} = a$
    Square both sides: $(b\sqrt{3})^2 = a^2$
    $3b^2 = a^2$
4.  **Deduce divisibility of `a`:** The equation $3b^2 = a^2$ implies that $a^2$ is divisible by 3.
    By **Theorem 1.2** (with $p=3$), since 3 is a prime number and 3 divides $a^2$, it follows that **3 divides $a$**.
5.  **Express `a` in terms of 3:** Since 3 divides $a$, we can write $a$ as $3c$ for some integer $c$.
6.  **Substitute and deduce divisibility of `b`:** Substitute $a = 3c$ into the equation $3b^2 = a^2$:
    $3b^2 = (3c)^2$
    $3b^2 = 9c^2$
    Divide both sides by 3: $b^2 = 3c^2$
    This implies that $b^2$ is divisible by 3.
    Again, using **Theorem 1.2** (with $p=3$), since 3 is a prime number and 3 divides $b^2$, it follows that **3 divides $b$**.
7.  **Identify the contradiction:** We have concluded that both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3. This means that $a$ and $b$ have 3 as a common factor.
    However, we assumed in step 2 that $a$ and $b$ are **coprime** (have no common factors other than 1).
    This is a **contradiction**.
8.  **Conclude original statement:** This contradiction arose because our initial assumption that $\sqrt{3}$ is rational was incorrect.
    Therefore, our assumption must be false, and we conclude that **$\sqrt{3}$ is irrational**.

**Example 6: Show that $5-\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.**

**Solution (by contradiction):**
1.  **Assume the contrary:** Let us assume, to the contrary, that $5-\sqrt{3}$ is a **rational number**.
2.  **Express as a fraction:** If $5-\sqrt{3}$ is rational, then we can find coprime integers $a$ and $b$ ($b \ne 0$) such that:
    $5 - \sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}$
3.  **Rearrange to isolate the irrational term:** Our goal is to isolate the known irrational part ($\sqrt{3}$) on one side of the equation.
    $5 - \frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{3}$
4.  **Simplify the rational side:**
    $\sqrt{3} = \frac{5b - a}{b}$
5.  **Deduce contradiction:** Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $5b - a$ will also be an integer, and $b$ is a non-zero integer. Therefore, the expression $\frac{5b - a}{b}$ is a fraction of two integers with a non-zero denominator, which means it is a **rational number**.
    So, our equation implies that $\sqrt{3}$ is a rational number.
    However, we already know (and proved in Example 5) that $\sqrt{3}$ is **irrational**.
    This is a **contradiction**.
6.  **Conclude original statement:** This contradiction arose because our initial assumption that $5-\sqrt{3}$ is rational was incorrect.
    Therefore, our assumption must be false, and we conclude that **$5-\sqrt{3}$ is irrational**.

**Example 7: Show that $3\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.**

**Solution (by contradiction):**
1.  **Assume the contrary:** Let us assume, to the contrary, that $3\sqrt{2}$ is a **rational number**.
2.  **Express as a fraction:** If $3\sqrt{2}$ is rational, then we can find coprime integers $a$ and $b$ ($b \ne 0$) such that:
    $3\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$
3.  **Rearrange to isolate the irrational term:**
    Divide both sides by 3: $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{3b}$
4.  **Deduce contradiction:** Since $3$, $a$, and $b$ are integers, and $b \ne 0$, the expression $\frac{a}{3b}$ is a fraction of two integers with a non-zero denominator. This means $\frac{a}{3b}$ is a **rational number**.
    So, our equation implies that $\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number.
    However, we already know (and proved in Theorem 1.3) that $\sqrt{2}$ is **irrational**.
    This is a **contradiction**.
5.  **Conclude original statement:** This contradiction arose because our initial assumption that $3\sqrt{2}$ is rational was incorrect.
    Therefore, our assumption must be false, and we conclude that **$3\sqrt{2}$ is irrational**.
