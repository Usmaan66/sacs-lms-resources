## 1.3 Revisiting Irrational Numbers

In Class 9, you learned about irrational numbers and some of their properties. You know that rational numbers (numbers that can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are integers and $q \ne 0$) and irrational numbers together make up the **real numbers**. You also learned how to locate irrational numbers on the number line. However, we didn't formally *prove* that certain numbers were irrational. In this section, we will prove that numbers like $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, $\sqrt{5}$, and generally $\sqrt{p}$ (where $p$ is a prime number) are irrational. A key tool for this proof will be the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**.

**Recall:** A number 's' is called **irrational** if it cannot be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \ne 0$.
Examples of irrational numbers: $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{15}, \pi, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}, 0.10110111110...$

Before we prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, we need another important theorem, which is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
