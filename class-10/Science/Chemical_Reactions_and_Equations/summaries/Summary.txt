## Summary
- A chemical equation shows reactants, products, and their states.
- Equations must be balanced to obey the law of conservation of mass.

**Types of Reactions:**
- **Combination:** two or more substances → one product
- **Decomposition:** one substance → simpler substances (needs energy)
- **Displacement:** more reactive element displaces less reactive one
- **Double Displacement:** exchange of ions between compounds
- **Oxidation:** gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen
- **Reduction:** loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen

- Corrosion and rancidity are effects of oxidation.
