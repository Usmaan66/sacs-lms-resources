## 1.1 Chemical Equations
A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction using symbols and formulae.

Let us convert the above word equation into a symbolic form:
- **Word Equation:** Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide  
- **Chemical Equation (skeletal):** Mg + O₂ → MgO

This is a skeletal equation because it does not show the balanced number of atoms.
