### Activity 1.4: Formation of Slaked Lime
**Objective:** To observe the reaction of calcium oxide with water.

**Steps:**
1. Take calcium oxide (quick lime) in a beaker.
2. Slowly add water to it.
3. Touch the beaker from outside.

**Observation:**
- The beaker becomes warm.

**Conclusion:**
Heat is released, indicating an exothermic reaction.

**Chemical Equation:** CaO(s) + H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(aq) + Heat

**Other examples of combination reactions:**
- C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)
- 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)

**Note:**
- If heat is released: **Exothermic Reaction**  
  Example: Respiration  
  Equation: C₆H₁₂O₆(aq) + 6O₂(aq) → 6CO₂(aq) + 6H₂O(l) + energy
