#### Activity 1.7: Electrolytic Decomposition of Water
**Objective:** To decompose water using electric current.

**Setup:**
- Use a plastic mug with carbon electrodes and a 6-volt battery.
- Fill it with water and add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid.
- Invert test tubes over each electrode to collect gases.

**Observation:**
- Bubbles form at both electrodes.
- Volume of gas at one electrode is double the other.

**Conclusion:**
Water decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen gas is collected in double the quantity of oxygen.

**Chemical Equation:**  
2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g)
