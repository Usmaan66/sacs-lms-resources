#### 1.3.1 Corrosion
Corrosion is the slow destruction of metals due to reactions with moisture, air, or acids.

- Iron gets covered with reddish-brown rust (iron oxide).
- Silver turns black due to silver sulphide.
- Copper develops a green coating (basic copper carbonate).

Corrosion weakens structures like bridges, railings, and ships.
