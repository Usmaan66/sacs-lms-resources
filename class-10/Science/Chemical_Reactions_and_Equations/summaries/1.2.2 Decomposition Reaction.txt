### 1.2.2 Decomposition Reaction
A decomposition reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. These reactions are the opposite of combination reactions.

Such reactions usually require an external source of energy—like heat, light, or electricity—to occur. Hence, decomposition reactions are often endothermic in nature, meaning they absorb energy.

**General form:** AB → A + B

Let us understand decomposition reactions with the help of some examples and activities:

#### Activity 1.5: Thermal Decomposition of Ferrous Sulphate
**Objective:** To observe the chemical changes when ferrous sulphate is heated.

**Steps:**
- Take about 2 g of green ferrous sulphate crystals in a dry boiling tube.
- Note their initial green colour.
- Heat the boiling tube over a flame.
- Observe any colour changes or gas release.

**Observation:**
- The green crystals turn brown.
- A smell of burning sulphur is noticed.

**Conclusion:**
Ferrous sulphate decomposes to form ferric oxide, sulphur dioxide, and sulphur trioxide.

**Chemical Equation:**  
2FeSO₄(s) → Fe₂O₃(s) + SO₂(g) + SO₃(g)

#### Activity 1.6: Thermal Decomposition of Lead Nitrate
**Objective:** To observe decomposition of lead nitrate on heating.

**Steps:**
- Take about 2 g of lead nitrate powder in a boiling tube.
- Heat it gently over a flame.
- Observe the colour of the fumes released.

**Observation:**
- Brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide gas are evolved.

**Conclusion:**
Lead nitrate decomposes into lead oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen.

**Chemical Equation:**  
2Pb(NO₃)₂(s) → 2PbO(s) + 4NO₂(g) + O₂(g)

#### Activity 1.7: Electrolytic Decomposition of Water
**Objective:** To decompose water using electric current.

**Setup:**
- Use a plastic mug with carbon electrodes and a 6-volt battery.
- Fill it with water and add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid.
- Invert test tubes over each electrode to collect gases.

**Observation:**
- Bubbles form at both electrodes.
- Volume of gas at one electrode is double the other.

**Conclusion:**
Water decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen gas is collected in double the quantity of oxygen.

**Chemical Equation:**  
2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g)

#### Activity 1.8: Photolytic Decomposition of Silver Chloride
**Objective:** To observe the effect of sunlight on silver chloride.

**Steps:**
- Take some white silver chloride in a china dish.
- Expose it to sunlight for a few minutes.

**Observation:**
- Silver chloride turns grey.

**Conclusion:**
Light causes decomposition of silver chloride into silver and chlorine.

**Chemical Equation:**  
2AgCl(s) → 2Ag(s) + Cl₂(g)

**Note:** This type of reaction is called photolytic decomposition (decomposition using light).

Silver bromide also behaves similarly:
- 2AgBr(s) → 2Ag(s) + Br₂(g)

These reactions are used in black-and-white photography.
