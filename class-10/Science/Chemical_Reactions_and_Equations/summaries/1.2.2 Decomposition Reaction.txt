### 1.2.2 Decomposition Reaction
A decomposition reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. These reactions are the opposite of combination reactions.

Such reactions usually require an external source of energy—like heat, light, or electricity—to occur. Hence, decomposition reactions are often endothermic in nature, meaning they absorb energy.

**General form:** AB → A + B

Let us understand decomposition reactions with the help of some examples and activities:
