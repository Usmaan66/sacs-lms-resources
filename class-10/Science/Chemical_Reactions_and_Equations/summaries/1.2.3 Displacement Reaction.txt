### 1.2.3 Displacement Reaction
A displacement reaction is a chemical reaction in which a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound.

**General form:** A + BC → AC + B

#### Activity 1.9: Iron Displacing Copper from Copper Sulphate Solution
**Objective:** To observe a displacement reaction between iron and copper sulphate.

**Steps:**
- Clean three iron nails with sandpaper.
- Take two test tubes (A and B). Pour 10 mL of copper sulphate solution in each.
- Place two iron nails in test tube B. Keep one nail aside for comparison.
- After 20 minutes, take out the nails from test tube B and compare their appearance.
- Observe the colour of the copper sulphate solutions in both test tubes.

**Observation:**
- The blue colour of the copper sulphate fades.
- Iron nails appear reddish-brown due to deposited copper.

**Conclusion:**
Iron has displaced copper from copper sulphate solution. This confirms that a displacement reaction has taken place.

**Chemical Equation:**  
Fe(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → FeSO₄(aq) + Cu(s)

**Other examples:**
- Zn(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + Cu(s)
- Pb(s) + CuCl₂(aq) → PbCl₂(aq) + Cu(s)
