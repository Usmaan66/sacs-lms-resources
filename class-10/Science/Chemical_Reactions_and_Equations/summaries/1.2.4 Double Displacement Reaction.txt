### 1.2.4 Double Displacement Reaction
In a double displacement reaction, two different compounds react by exchanging ions to form new compounds. One of the products is usually a precipitate (an insoluble solid).

**General form:** AB + CD → AD + CB

#### Activity 1.10: Sodium Sulphate and Barium Chloride Reaction
**Objective:** To observe the formation of a precipitate in a double displacement reaction.

**Steps:**
- Take 3 mL of sodium sulphate solution in a test tube.
- Take 3 mL of barium chloride solution in another test tube.
- Mix the two solutions.

**Observation:**
- A white precipitate is formed.

**Conclusion:**
Barium sulphate is formed as a white, insoluble precipitate. This is a double displacement reaction.

**Chemical Equation:**  
Na₂SO₄(aq) + BaCl₂(aq) → BaSO₄(s) + 2NaCl(aq)
