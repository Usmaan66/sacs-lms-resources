### 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations
Chemical equations must follow the Law of Conservation of Mass:
> "Mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction."

This means the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides.

Let us balance the following equation step by step:

**Unbalanced Equation:** Fe + H₂O → Fe₃O₄ + H₂

**Step-by-step balancing (Hit-and-Trial Method):**
1. Balance oxygen by placing 4 in front of H₂O: Fe + 4H₂O → Fe₃O₄ + H₂
2. Balance hydrogen: 4H₂O has 8 hydrogen atoms. So, put 4 in front of H₂: Fe + 4H₂O → Fe₃O₄ + 4H₂
3. Balance iron: Fe₃O₄ has 3 iron atoms. So, put 3 in front of Fe:  
   **Balanced Equation:** 3Fe + 4H₂O → Fe₃O₄ + 4H₂

**Adding physical states:**  
**3Fe(s) + 4H₂O(g) → Fe₃O₄(s) + 4H₂(g)**

**Note:**
- (s): solid
- (l): liquid
- (g): gas
- (aq): aqueous (dissolved in water)
