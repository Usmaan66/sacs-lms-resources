### 1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction (Redox Reactions)
Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or the loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen or the gain of hydrogen.

When both oxidation and reduction occur together in a reaction, it is called a redox reaction.

#### Activity 1.11: Heating Copper Powder
**Objective:** To observe oxidation of copper.

**Steps:**
- Heat copper powder in a china dish.

**Observation:**
- Copper turns black due to the formation of copper oxide.

**Equation:**  
2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO (Copper is oxidised)

**Reduction Reaction (Reverse Reaction):**  
When hydrogen gas is passed over hot copper oxide:
CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O (CuO is reduced)

**Examples of redox reactions:**
- ZnO + C → Zn + CO (C is oxidised, ZnO is reduced)
- MnO₂ + 4HCl → MnCl₂ + Cl₂ + 2H₂O (HCl is oxidised, MnO₂ is reduced)
