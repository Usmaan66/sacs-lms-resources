### Activity 1.1: Burning of Magnesium Ribbon
**Objective:** To observe the chemical change when magnesium is burnt in air.

**Materials Needed:**
- Magnesium ribbon (3–4 cm long)
- Sandpaper
- Tongs
- Spirit lamp or burner
- Watch-glass

**Steps:**
1. Clean the magnesium ribbon with sandpaper to remove any coating of magnesium oxide.
2. Hold the ribbon with tongs.
3. Burn it using a spirit lamp or burner.
4. Collect the white ash formed in a watch-glass.

**Observation:**
- Magnesium burns with a dazzling white flame.
- A white ash (magnesium oxide) is formed.

**Conclusion:**
A chemical reaction has taken place as a new substance (magnesium oxide) is formed.

**Word Equation:** Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide  
**Chemical Equation:** Mg + O₂ → MgO
