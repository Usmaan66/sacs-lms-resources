## Introduction
In our daily life, we come across many changes. Some changes are temporary and easily reversible, such as melting of ice or dissolving salt in water. But other changes result in the formation of new substances and are often irreversible. These are called chemical changes, and they occur due to chemical reactions.

Let us understand this better with some real-life examples:
- Milk turns sour if left at room temperature.
- Iron tools like nails or pans become reddish-brown when left in a humid atmosphere.
- Grapes ferment to produce alcohol.
- Cooking food and digestion in our bodies.
- Breathing in and out (respiration).

In all these cases, the substances we start with are transformed into new substances with different properties. This transformation is the essence of a chemical reaction.

But how do we know that a chemical reaction has occurred? We look for signs such as:
- Change in state (solid, liquid, gas)
- Change in colour
- Evolution of a gas
- Change in temperature

Let us perform some activities to explore these signs.
