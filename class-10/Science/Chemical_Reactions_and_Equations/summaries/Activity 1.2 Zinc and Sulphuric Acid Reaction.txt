### Activity 1.2: Zinc and Sulphuric Acid Reaction
**Objective:** To observe the reaction of zinc with sulphuric acid.

**Materials:**
- Zinc granules
- Dilute sulphuric acid
- Conical flask or test tube

**Steps:**
1. Take some zinc granules in a test tube.
2. Add dilute sulphuric acid.
3. Observe the reaction and feel the test tube.

**Observation:**
- Bubbles (hydrogen gas) are formed.
- The test tube becomes warm.

**Conclusion:**
Hydrogen gas is released and heat is produced, indicating a chemical change.

**Word Equation:** Zinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen  
**Balanced Chemical Equation:** Zn + H₂SO₄ → ZnSO₄ + H₂
