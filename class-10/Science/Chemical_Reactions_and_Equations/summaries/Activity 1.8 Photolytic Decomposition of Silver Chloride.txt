#### Activity 1.8: Photolytic Decomposition of Silver Chloride
**Objective:** To observe the effect of sunlight on silver chloride.

**Steps:**
- Take some white silver chloride in a china dish.
- Expose it to sunlight for a few minutes.

**Observation:**
- Silver chloride turns grey.

**Conclusion:**
Light causes decomposition of silver chloride into silver and chlorine.

**Chemical Equation:**  
2AgCl(s) → 2Ag(s) + Cl₂(g)

**Note:** This type of reaction is called photolytic decomposition (decomposition using light).

Silver bromide also behaves similarly:
- 2AgBr(s) → 2Ag(s) + Br₂(g)

These reactions are used in black-and-white photography.
