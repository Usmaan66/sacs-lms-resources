#### Activity 1.6: Thermal Decomposition of Lead Nitrate
**Objective:** To observe decomposition of lead nitrate on heating.

**Steps:**
- Take about 2 g of lead nitrate powder in a boiling tube.
- Heat it gently over a flame.
- Observe the colour of the fumes released.

**Observation:**
- Brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide gas are evolved.

**Conclusion:**
Lead nitrate decomposes into lead oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen.

**Chemical Equation:**  
2Pb(NO₃)₂(s) → 2PbO(s) + 4NO₂(g) + O₂(g)
