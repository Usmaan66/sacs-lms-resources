### 4.2 Italy Unified

**Political Fragmentation:** Like Germany, Italy had a long history of political division.

* Italians scattered over dynastic states and the Habsburg Empire.
* **Mid-19th century:** Divided into **seven states**. Only Sardinia-Piedmont ruled by an Italian princely house.
    * **North:** Austrian Habsburgs.
    * **Centre:** Pope.
    * **South:** Bourbon kings of Spain.
* **Language:** Italian language lacked a common form, with many regional variations.

**Giuseppe Mazzini's Programme:** During the 1830s, Mazzini tried to create a coherent program for a unitary Italian Republic and formed Young Italy.

* Failure of uprisings in 1831 and 1848 meant the task fell to Sardinia-Piedmont.

**Sardinia-Piedmont's Role:** Under King Victor Emmanuel II, aimed to unify Italian states through war.

* Ruling elites saw unification as an opportunity for economic development and political dominance.
* **Chief Minister Cavour:**
    * Neither a revolutionary nor a democrat.
    * Spoke French better than Italian.
    * Engineered a tactful diplomatic alliance with France.
    * **Outcome:** Sardinia-Piedmont defeated Austrian forces in **1859**.
* **Giuseppe Garibaldi (Italian freedom fighter):**
    * Led a large number of armed volunteers (known as Red Shirts).
    * In **1860**, marched into South Italy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.
    * Won support of local peasants to drive out Spanish rulers.
    * **1867:** Led volunteers to Rome to fight the Papal States (French garrison stationed there).
    * **1870:** French troops withdrew from Rome during war with Prussia, allowing Papal States to join Italy.

**United Italy Proclaimed:** In **1861**, Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed king of united Italy.

**Public Awareness:** Much of the Italian population (high illiteracy) remained unaware of liberal-nationalist ideology. Many peasants supporting Garibaldi hadn't heard of 'Italia' and believed 'La Talia' was Victor Emmanuel's wife.
