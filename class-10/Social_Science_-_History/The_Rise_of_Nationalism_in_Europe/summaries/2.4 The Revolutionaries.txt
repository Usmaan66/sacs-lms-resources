### 2.4 The Revolutionaries

**Underground Societies:** Fear of repression after 1815 drove liberal-nationalists underground. Secret societies emerged to train revolutionaries and spread ideas.

**Revolutionary Goal:** Oppose monarchical forms established by the Vienna Congress and fight for liberty and freedom. Many saw nation-states as crucial for this struggle.

**Giuseppe Mazzini (Italian Revolutionary):**

* Born in Genoa in **1805**.
* Member of the secret society of the Carbonari.
* Exiled in **1831** for attempting a revolution in Liguria.
* Founded two more underground societies:
    * **Young Italy** in Marseilles.
    * **Young Europe** in Berne (members from Poland, France, Italy, German states).
* **Belief:** God intended nations as natural units of mankind; Italy must be a unified republic within an alliance of nations. This unification was key to Italian liberty.
* **Influence:** His model led to secret societies in Germany, France, Switzerland, and Poland.
* **Conservative Fear:** Mazzini's opposition to monarchy and vision of democratic republics frightened conservatives. Metternich called him "the most dangerous enemy of our social order."
