### 2.3 A New Conservatism after 1815

**Context:** Following Napoleon's defeat in **1815**, European governments adopted conservatism.

**Conservative Beliefs:** Preservation of established, traditional institutions (monarchy, Church, social hierarchies, property, family).

**Modernization:** Most conservatives realized that reforms (modern army, efficient bureaucracy, dynamic economy, abolition of feudalism/serfdom) could strengthen autocratic monarchies.

**Congress of Vienna (1815):**

* **Host:** Austrian Chancellor **Duke Metternich**.
* **Participants:** Representatives of Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria.
* **Objective:** Undo most changes of the Napoleonic wars and create a new conservative order.
* **Outcomes (Treaty of Vienna, 1815):**
    * Bourbon dynasty restored to power in France.
    * France lost annexed territories.
    * Series of states set up on French boundaries to prevent future expansion (e.g., Kingdom of Netherlands with Belgium in north, Genoa added to Piedmont in south).
    * Prussia gained new western territories.
    * Austria gained control of northern Italy.
    * German Confederation of **39 states** (set up by Napoleon) left untouched.
    * Russia gained part of Poland.
    * Prussia gained a portion of Saxony.

**Conservative Regimes after 1815:**

* Autocratic.
* Did not tolerate criticism or dissent.
* Imposed censorship laws to control news, books, plays, and songs (ideas of liberty/freedom associated with French Revolution were suppressed).
* The memory of the French Revolution continued to inspire liberals.
* Liberal-nationalists criticized the new conservative order and demanded freedom of the press.

**New Word:** **Conservatism:** A political philosophy stressing tradition, established institutions, customs, and gradual development over quick change.
