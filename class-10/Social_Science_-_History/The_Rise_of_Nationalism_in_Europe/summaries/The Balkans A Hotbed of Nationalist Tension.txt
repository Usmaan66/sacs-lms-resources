### The Balkans: A Hotbed of Nationalist Tension

* **Most Serious Source (after 1871):** The Balkans.
* **Region:** Geographically and ethnically diverse, including modern-day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia, and Montenegro.
    * Inhabitants broadly known as Slavs.

**Ottoman Control:** Large part under the Ottoman Empire.

**Factors Leading to Explosion:**

* Spread of romantic nationalism in the Balkans.
* Disintegration of the Ottoman Empire (which failed to strengthen itself through modernization).
* European subject nationalities broke away and declared independence.

**Claims for Independence:** Balkan peoples based claims on nationality, using history to prove they were once independent but subjugated by foreign powers. They saw their struggles as winning back long-lost independence.

**Intense Conflict:** Different Slavic nationalities struggled to define identity and independence, leading to intense conflict.

* Balkan states were fiercely jealous, each seeking more territory.

**Big Power Rivalry:** Balkans became a scene of rivalry among European powers (Russia, Germany, England, Austro-Hungary) over trade, colonies, and military might. Each wanted to counter others' hold and extend its own control.

* Led to a series of wars in the region and finally the First World War.

**Outcome:** Nationalism, aligned with imperialism, led Europe to disaster in **1914**.

**Anti-Imperial Movements:** In the 19th century, many colonized countries began to oppose imperial domination.

* These movements were nationalist: struggling for independent nation-states, inspired by collective national unity forged in confrontation with imperialism.
* European ideas of nationalism were not replicated; people developed their own specific varieties.
* However, the idea that societies should be organized into 'nation-states' became universally accepted.
