## 2 The Making of Nationalism in Europe

**Mid-18th Century Europe:** No "nation-states" as we know them.

* Germany, Italy, Switzerland were divided into kingdoms, duchies, and cantons.
* Eastern and Central Europe were under autocratic monarchies with diverse peoples speaking different languages and belonging to different ethnic groups (e.g., Habsburg Empire was a patchwork of regions and peoples like Tyrol, Austria, Sudetenland, Bohemia, Lombardy, Venetia, Hungary, Galicia, and various subject peasant groups).
* **Common Tie:** Allegiance to the emperor was the only binding factor.
