### Napoleon's Impact:

* **Return to Monarchy:** Napoleon destroyed democracy in France.
* **Administrative Reforms (Napoleonic Code/Civil Code of 1804):**
    * Did away with privileges based on birth.
    * Established equality before the law.
    * Secured the right to property.
* **Exported to French-controlled Regions:** Applied in the Dutch Republic, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany.
    * Simplified administrative divisions.
    * Abolished feudal system and freed peasants from serfdom and manorial dues.
    * Removed guild restrictions in towns.
    * Improved transport and communication systems.
* **Benefits for Businessmen:** Uniform laws, standardized weights/measures, and a common national currency facilitated trade.
* **Mixed Reactions:** Initial enthusiasm (French armies as 'harbingers of liberty') turned to hostility due to:
    * Increased taxation.
    * Censorship.
    * Forced conscription into French armies for conquests.
