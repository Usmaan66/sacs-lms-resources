## Introduction: Frédéric Sorrieu's Vision

In 1848, French artist **Frédéric Sorrieu** created a series of four prints envisioning a world of 'democratic and social Republics'.

* **The First Print (Fig. 1):** Shows people of Europe and America (men and women of all ages and social classes) marching towards the Statue of Liberty, offering homage.
    * **Statue of Liberty:** Holds the torch of Enlightenment in one hand and the Charter of the Rights of Man in the other.
    * **Foreground:** Shattered remains of symbols of absolutist institutions (monarchical rule without restraints).
    * **Nations Identified:** People are grouped by their distinct flags and national costumes.
    * **Leading the Procession:** USA and Switzerland (already nation-states by 1848).
    * **Following:** France (with the tricolour flag), then Germany (with black, red, gold flag – symbolizing liberal hopes for unification in 1848), followed by Austria, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Lombardy, Poland, England, Ireland, Hungary, and Russia.
    * **Heavens Above:** Christ, saints, and angels symbolize fraternity among nations.

**Key Idea:** Nationalism brought sweeping changes, leading to nation-states instead of dynastic empires. A **nation-state** is where the majority of citizens develop a shared identity and history, forged through struggles and actions of leaders and common people.

**New Words:**

* **Absolutist:** A government or system of rule with no restraints on power, often centralized, militarized, and repressive monarchies.
* **Utopian:** A vision of a society so ideal it's unlikely to exist.
* **Plebiscite:** A direct vote by all people of a region to accept or reject a proposal.
