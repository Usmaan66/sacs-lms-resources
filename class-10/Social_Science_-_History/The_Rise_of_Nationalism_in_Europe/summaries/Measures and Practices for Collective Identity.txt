### Measures and Practices for Collective Identity:

French revolutionaries introduced various changes:

* **Ideas:**
    * *la patrie* (the fatherland)
    * *le citoyen* (the citizen)
    * Emphasized a united community with equal rights under a constitution.
* **Flag:** A new French tricolour flag replaced the royal standard.
* **Assembly:** The Estates General was elected by active citizens and renamed the National Assembly.
* **Symbols:** New hymns, oaths, and commemoration of martyrs, all in the name of the nation.
* **Administration:** Centralized administrative system with uniform laws for all citizens.
* **Economic Reforms:**
    * Internal customs duties and dues abolished.
    * Uniform system of weights and measures adopted.
    * Common national currency to facilitate trade (introduced by Napoleon later).
* **Language:** Regional dialects were discouraged; French (spoken and written in Paris) became the common language.
* **Mission of the French Nation:** Revolutionaries declared it their destiny to liberate other peoples of Europe from despotism and help them become nations.
* **Spread of Ideas:** News of events in France led students and educated middle classes to set up Jacobin clubs across Europe.
* **French Armies:** In the 1790s, French armies moved into Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy, carrying the idea of nationalism abroad during the revolutionary wars.
