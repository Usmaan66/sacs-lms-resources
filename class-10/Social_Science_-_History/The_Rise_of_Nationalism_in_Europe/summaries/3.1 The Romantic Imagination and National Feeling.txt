### 3.1 The Romantic Imagination and National Feeling

**Role of Culture:** Nationalism developed not just through wars, but also through culture: art, poetry, stories, music helped express and shape nationalist feelings.

**Romanticism (Cultural Movement):** Sought to develop nationalist sentiment, emphasizing emotions, intuition, and mystical feelings over reason and science.

* **Goal:** Create a shared collective heritage and common cultural past as the nation's basis.

**Johann Gottfried Herder (German philosopher, 1744-1803):**

* Claimed true German culture (*das volk* - common people) was discovered through folk songs, poetry, and dances (*volksgeist* - true spirit of the nation).
* Collecting and recording folk culture was essential for nation-building.

**The Grimm Brothers (Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm):**

* Collected old folktales (published first collection in **1812**).
* Became active in liberal politics (freedom of the press).
* Published a **33-volume dictionary** of the German language.
* Viewed French domination as a threat to German culture; believed folktales expressed pure German spirit. Their projects aimed to oppose French domination and create German national identity.

**Vernacular Language and Folklore:** Not only to recover ancient national spirit but also to carry the nationalist message to illiterate audiences.

**Poland Example:**

* Partitioned by Russia, Prussia, Austria (late 18th century).
* National feelings kept alive through music and language.
* **Karol Kurpinski:** Celebrated national struggle through operas and music, turning folk dances (polonaise, mazurka) into nationalist symbols.
* **Language as Resistance:** Polish language forced out of schools by Russian occupation.
* **1831 Rebellion:** Armed rebellion against Russian rule crushed.
* **Clergy:** Used Polish for Church gatherings and religious instruction; many jailed or sent to Siberia for refusing to preach in Russian. Polish became a symbol of struggle against Russian dominance.
