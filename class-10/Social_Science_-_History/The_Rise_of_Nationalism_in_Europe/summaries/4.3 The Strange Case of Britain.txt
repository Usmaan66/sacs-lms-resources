### 4.3 The Strange Case of Britain

**Model of Nation-State:** Scholars consider Great Britain a unique case.

**Process:** Not a sudden revolution, but a long-drawn-out process.

**No British Nation (pre-18th century):** Primary identities were ethnic (English, Welsh, Scot, Irish), each with cultural and political traditions.

**English Dominance:** English nation grew in wealth, importance, and power, extending influence over other islands.

**English Parliament:** Seized power from monarchy in **1688**, became the instrument for forging a nation-state with England at its center.

**Act of Union (1707):**

* Between England and Scotland.
* Formed the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain’.
* Effectively, England imposed its influence on Scotland.
* British Parliament dominated by English members.
* Scottish culture and institutions systematically suppressed (e.g., forbidding Gaelic, national dress, forced removals from Highlands).

**Ireland's Fate:**

* Deeply divided between Catholics and Protestants.
* English helped Irish Protestants establish dominance over the Catholic majority.
* Catholic revolts (e.g., by Wolfe Tone and his United Irishmen in **1798**) were suppressed.
* **Forcibly Incorporated:** Ireland incorporated into the United Kingdom in **1801**.

**New 'British Nation':** Forged through propagation of a dominant English culture.

* **Symbols:** British flag (Union Jack), national anthem (God Save Our Noble King), English language actively promoted.
* Older nations survived as subordinate partners.

**New Word:** **Ethnic:** Relates to a common racial, tribal, or cultural origin or background a community identifies with or claims.
