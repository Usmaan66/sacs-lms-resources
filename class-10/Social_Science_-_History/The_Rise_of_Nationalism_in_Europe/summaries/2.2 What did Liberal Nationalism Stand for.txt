### 2.2 What did Liberal Nationalism Stand for?

**Ideology of Liberalism:** Closely allied with national unity in early 19th-century Europe. Derived from Latin root 'liber' (free).

**Political Sphere:**

* Freedom for the individual and equality of all before the law.
* Government by consent.
* End of autocracy and clerical privileges.
* A constitution and representative government through parliament.
* Inviolability of private property.
* **Limited Suffrage:** Equality before the law did not mean universal suffrage.
    * **Revolutionary France:** Only property-owning men could vote and be elected.
    * **Jacobins:** Brief period where all adult males had suffrage.
    * **Napoleonic Code:** Returned to limited suffrage, women reduced to minor status.
    * **Women and non-propertied men:** Organized movements for equal political rights throughout 19th and early 20th centuries.

**New Word:** **Suffrage:** The right to vote.

**Economic Sphere:**

* Freedom of markets.
* Abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement of goods and capital.
* **Example (German-speaking regions, early 19th century):**
    * Napoleon created a confederation of **39 states**.
    * Each had its own currency, weights, and measures.
    * A merchant faced **11 customs barriers** and **5% duty at each**, with time-consuming calculations due to differing *elle* lengths for cloth.
* **Demand for Unified Economic Territory:** New commercial classes wanted unhindered movement of goods, people, and capital.
* **Zollverein (Customs Union):** Formed in **1834** at Prussia's initiative, joined by most German states.
    * Abolished tariff barriers.
    * Reduced currencies from **over thirty to two**.
    * Railway networks stimulated mobility.
    * Strengthened economic nationalism and wider nationalist sentiments.
