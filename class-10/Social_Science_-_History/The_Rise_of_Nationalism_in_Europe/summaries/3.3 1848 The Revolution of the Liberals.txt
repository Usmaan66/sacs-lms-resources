### 3.3 1848: The Revolution of the Liberals

**Parallel Revolts:** Alongside peasant/worker revolts, a revolution led by educated middle classes was underway.

* **February 1848 (France):** Monarch abdicated, republic based on universal male suffrage proclaimed.
* **Other European Parts:** In Germany, Italy, Poland, Austro-Hungarian Empire (where nation-states didn't exist), liberal middle classes combined demands for constitutionalism with national unification.
    * Used popular unrest to push for a nation-state based on parliamentary principles: constitution, freedom of the press, freedom of association.

**Frankfurt Parliament (Germany):**

* Many political associations (middle-class professionals, businessmen, artisans) gathered in Frankfurt.
* Voted for an all-German National Assembly.
* **May 18, 1848:** **831** elected representatives marched to the Church of St Paul to convene the Frankfurt Parliament.
* Drafted a constitution for a German nation headed by a monarchy subject to a parliament.
* **Rejection:** Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV rejected the crown offered on these terms and joined other monarchs to oppose the assembly.
* **Erosion of Support:** Parliament dominated by middle classes, who resisted demands of workers and artisans, losing their support.
* **Disbandment:** Troops called in, assembly forced to disband.

**Women's Political Rights:** Controversial issue within the liberal movement.

* Women actively participated: formed political associations, founded newspapers, joined meetings and demonstrations.
* **Denied Suffrage:** Excluded from voting rights during the Assembly elections.
* **Frankfurt Parliament:** Admitted only as observers in the visitors' gallery.
* **Carl Welcker (liberal politician):** Argued nature created men and women for different functions (man for public tasks, woman for home).
* **Louise Otto-Peters (feminist activist):** Criticized men fighting for freedom only for "one half of humanity," stating "Liberty is indivisible!"
* **Anonymous Reader:** Highlighted injustice of denying property-owning, talented women voting rights while "stupidest cattle-herder" could vote.

**New Word:** **Feminist:** Awareness of women's rights and interests based on belief in social, economic, and political equality of genders.

**New Word:** **Ideology:** System of ideas reflecting a particular social and political vision.

**Conservative Concessions:** Though liberal movements were suppressed in 1848, the old order couldn't be fully restored. Monarchs realized they needed to grant concessions to avoid further revolutions.

* **Post-1848:** Autocratic monarchies in Central and Eastern Europe introduced changes already seen in Western Europe before 1815.
* **Abolition:** Serfdom and bonded labor abolished in Habsburg dominions and Russia.
* **Autonomy:** Habsburg rulers granted more autonomy to Hungarians in **1867**.
