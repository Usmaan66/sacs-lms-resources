2.1 Kingdom Monera
•	Includes all prokaryotic organisms, mainly bacteria.
•	They are the most abundant and diverse micro-organisms.
Habitat
•	Found in extreme conditions: hot springs, deserts, snow, deep oceans.
Nutrition
•	Show high metabolic diversity:
o	Autotrophic: Make their own food (photosynthetic or chemosynthetic)
o	Heterotrophic: Depend on others for food
Shapes of Bacteria
1.	Coccus – spherical (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae)
2.	Bacillus – rod-shaped (e.g., E. coli, Bacillus anthracis)
3.	Spirillum – spiral (e.g., Spirillum, Treponema)
4.	Vibrio – comma-shaped (e.g., Vibrio cholerae)
Types of Bacteria
2.1.1 Archaebacteria
•	Live in harsh environments like salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles), marshes (methanogens)
•	Have a unique cell wall that helps them survive extreme conditions
•	Methanogens produce biogas (methane)
2.1.2 Eubacteria
•	Have a rigid cell wall and may have flagella for movement
•	Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae):
o	Have chlorophyll like plants
o	Are photosynthetic
o	May be unicellular, colonial, or filamentous
o	Found in freshwater, marine, and soil habitats
o	Some fix nitrogen using heterocysts (e.g., Nostoc, Anabaena)
Nutrition in Eubacteria
•	Chemosynthetic autotrophs: Use inorganic substances like nitrates, nitrites for energy
•	Heterotrophs: Decomposers, impact human life (e.g., curd formation, antibiotics)
Reproduction in Bacteria
•	Binary fission: In favorable conditions
•	Spore formation: In unfavorable conditions
•	Sexual reproduction (primitive): DNA transfer between bacteria
Mycoplasma
•	Bacteria without a cell wall
•	Smallest living cells
•	Survive without oxygen
•	Some are pathogenic in plants and animals
